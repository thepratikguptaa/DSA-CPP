## What are Data Structures?

In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that is designed to organize data to be accessed and worked with in various ways. It is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. 

Common data structures include:
*   Arrays
*   Linked Lists
*   Stacks
*   Queues
*   Trees
*   Graphs
*   Hash Tables

## What are Algorithms?

An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing. 

## Why are they important?

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science. They are essential for designing and implementing efficient software. Understanding DSA helps in:

*   **Problem Solving:** They provide a framework for solving complex problems.
*   **Efficiency:** Choosing the right data structure and algorithm can significantly improve the performance of an application.
*   **Interview Preparation:** DSA is a crucial topic for technical interviews at major tech companies.
